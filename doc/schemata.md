# YAML schema writing
## Outline

Each data file has a schema, which we use both to validate and describe data. The [SAVED data model/ontology](https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/schema/) is based on [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml/), with schema files authored in the YAML format. It is useful to think about these files as being made up of two main elements:

1. Metadata about the schema file. These declare certain fields essential for validation of the schema (e.g. a unique identifier and name for the schema), as well as extra, optional data such as its license, or when it was last updated.
2. Fields which describe the structure of data files to be validated against the schema. These associate the names columns with a description, a data type (e.g. text field, or number), a provenance (e.g. modelled, or simulated), and with a variable described in the data model (e.g. [`saved:lice_af_total`](https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/schema/lice_af_total/)).

Top-level fields of a typical schema are summarised as follows:

| Field             | Description                                                                            | Do I need this? | Example  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | Fully unique resource identifier: a URI                                                | Yes             | `id: https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/rap/sentinel_cages_sampling`              |
| `name`            | Name of the resource, an 'atom' (text field with no spaces, only underscores)          | Yes             | `name: sentinel_cages_sampling`                                                       |
| `title`           | Longer title of the schema: this may be free text                                      | Yes             | `title: Sentinel cages sampling information schema`                                   |
| `description`     | Long-form free text description of the schema                                          | No              | `description: This is the example schema for sentinel cages samplingâ€¦`                |

## YAML syntax

YAML documents are made up of blocks, with indentation indicating membership of elements, and elements as mappings between 'atoms' and values. For example, in the LinkML schema, the slot for the `Sampling.Note` column is declared as follows:

```yaml
slots:
  Sampling.Note:
    description: "Notes on issues with sampling"
	range:       string
	required:    false
	exact_mappings:
	  -  saved:date
```

Key things to keep in mind:
1. YAML is a machine-readable language, and indentation matters. In the above example, if `range` was indented two spaces fewer, it would not be considered to be part of the `Sampling.Note` block.
2. It is not necessary to quote the majority of text fields (even free text), except if the text includes control characters used by YAML, such as colons (which mark key/value pairs), dashes (which designate lists), or hashes (which designate comments).
3. If a text field is multi-line (sometimes useful for descriptions), you need to use `>-` and indent the text in question below. The end of the indentation, here, rather than quotes, marks the end of the text field.

## Metadata about the schema file

### The `id`, `name`, `title` and `description` fields

The exact distinction between these is not at first glance very clear. It can be summarised as follows:

1. The identifier (`id`) is a unique resource where the schema file may (perhaps should) live in the future. The examples use the "rap" directory under the SAVED prefix hosted on the Marine Scotland namespace. If you are not Marine Scotland, it is preferable to choose a URI which you control and could host something there. In any case, this field is necessary for a schema to be valid and to validate data files.
2. The name field is the a unique name for the schema. This is an "atom" with no spaces, only underscores. It is likely easiest just to use the end of the identifier above, e.g. for the ID `https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/rap/sentinel_cages_sampling`, one might choose the name `sentinel_cages_sampling`.
3. The title of the resource is a free text field. Keep it relatively short as this will make the generated output (web pages) clearer.
4. The description is a longer free text field. Whereas the identifier, name and title fields are mandatory, this description is not. This is the place to put longer descriptions of the data, rather than the title field, although they both allow free text.

### Prefixes and imports
#### Prefixes

**Prefixes** are a collection of between an atom (text field with no spaces, only underscores) and a URI prefix. These mappings are prefixes because they are used to create unique identifiers from names, i.e. they prefix the name of a thing. Rather than type out the name of the URI every time, we use the short atom to refer to it.

Consider the following set of prefixes:

```yaml
prefixes:
  linkml: https://w3id.org/linkml/
  xsd:    http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#
  saved:  https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/schema/
  rap:    https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/rap/
  mssamp: https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/rap/sentinel_cages_sampling/
```

Identifiers are referenced using the form `<atom>:<resource name>`, and are expanded to `<prefix URI><resource name>`. The last character of the prefix URI is important because the expansion does not assume anything about it, e.g. both the `xsd` (which ends in a hash) and the other prefixes are valid. The expansion is very simple. The identifier `saved:lice_af_total` would expand to `https://marine.gov.scot/metadata/saved/schema/lice_af_total`.

**Imports** are a link to an external LinkML schema, from which items declared in the schema are imported.

Consider the following set of imports:

```yaml
imports:
  linkml:types
  linkml:datasets
  saved:core
  saved:job
```
